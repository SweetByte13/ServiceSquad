## Introduction

ServiceSquad is a full-stack application that allows a user to create an account and search for community service opportunites in their area. 
A user is able to:
- Create a profile, and log in/out of the app.
- Update their profile and preferences.
- Delete their profile. 
- Search for community service opportunities based on location, activities, category, and organization.
- Search for community service organizations in their area by name.

## About Us

ServiceSquad was created by Tova Hillman, Julia Whey, and Erin Yant. We drew inspiration from myvoluntier.com, and created our dream app that allows community members to find organizations in their area and connect about volunteer opportunites.
